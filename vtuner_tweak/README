vtunerc linux kernel driver is part of virtualized DVB
adapter project named "vtuner".

Please read more information on project home page:
http://code.google.com/p/vtuner/

Because of very forbiddingly reaction of some
DVB developers on driver review the driver stays outside
of kernel source code.

Developers are doing theirs best to stay in sync
with kernel DVB changes every time when some
of that occurs. 

Of course, any patches or other help are highly welcome.

// only few comments, yet ;)

Driver needs companion userspace applications from http://code.google.com/p/dreamtuner/

Devices permissions:

  Driver is registering the following devices:

    DVB:

    /dev/dvb/adapterX/demux0
    /dev/dvb/adapterX/dvr0
    /dev/dvb/adapterX/frontend0 [registered later]

    controlling:

    /dev/vtunerX

    where X is ordered by driver installation.

  All devices get default device permissions, what usually
  can't be exactly what we need (like 660 root/root).

  There is no simple way of changing permissions of
  created files from driver. 

  The only right(tm) way is using some upper layer
  subsystem. What means, int time of writing such notes,
  writing udev rules.

  This rule works:

  KERNEL=="vtunerc*", MODE="0666"
  
  put it in /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules (in Gentoo)

  ...
